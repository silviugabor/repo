# RxJava 2 Releases #

The cnagelog of version 1.x can be found at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/1.x/CHANGES.md

### Version 2.1.0 - April 29, 2017 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.1.0%7C))

#### Summary

Version 2.1.0 is the next minor release of the 2.x era and contains the standardization of many experimental API additions from the past half a year since version 2.0.0. Therefore, the following components are now considered stable and will be supported throughout the rest of the life of RxJava 2.x.

**Classes, Enums, Annotations**

- Annotation: `CheckReturnValue`
- Subjects: `CompletableSubject`, `MaybeSubject`, `SingleSubject`
- Enum: `TestWaitStrategy`

**Operators**

- **`Flowable`**: `doAfterNext`, `doFinally`, `sample` (emitLast)
- **`Observable`**: `doAfterNext`, `doFinally`, `sample` (emitLast)
- **`Single`**: `doAfterSuccess`, `doAfterTerminate`, `doFinally`
- **`Maybe`**: `doAfterSuccess`, `doFinally`, `flatMapSingleElement`
- **`Completable`**: `cache`, `doFinally`, `hide`
- **`Test{Observer, Subscriber}`**: `assertNever`, `assertTimeout`, `assertNoTimeout`, `awaitCount`, `clearTimeout`, `isTimeout`, `withTag`
- **`RxJavaPlugins`**: `createComputationScheduler`, `createIoScheduler`, `createNewThreadScheduler`, `createSingleScheduler`, `getOnBeforeBlocking`, `setOnBeforeBlocking`, `isFailOnBlockingScheduler`, `setFailOnBlockingScheduler`.
- Other: `Scheduler.when`, `TestSubscriber.requestMore`

*(For the complete list and details on the promotions, see issue [5243](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5243).)*

Release 2.1.0 is functionally identical to 2.0.9 except the removal of [now unnecessary](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/releases/tag/v2.0.7) `Flowable.strict()` operator. To clarify, just like with previous minor version increments with RxJava, there won't be any further development or updates on the version 2.0.x (patch) level. 

##### Beta promotions

Some of the enhancements of RxJava 2.0.x were added recently which often represent complex additions to RxJava itself (such as the whole `ParallelFlowable`). We are confident their functionality adds value to the library but not enough time elapsed since their introduction for the community to try it out and provide feedback on them (i.e., naming, encompassed functionality, etc.). To indicate we are willing to support them and eventually standardize them in the next minor release, the following components have been promoted to the status of `Beta`:

- Classes: `OnErrorNotImplementedException`, `ProtocolViolationException`, `UndeliverableException`, 
 `ParallelFlowable`
- Interface: `FlowableSubscriber`
- Methods
  - **`Flowable`**: `parallel`, `subscribe(FlowableSubscriber)`
  - **`RxJavaPlugins`**: `getOnParallelAssembly`, `onAssembly(ParallelFlowable)`, `setOnParallelAssembly`

#### Non-functional changes between 2.0.9 and 2.1

- [Pull 5306](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/5306): Change `ObservableSource.defer` to `Observable.defer` in `Observable.scan()` documentation.
- [Pull 5309](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/5309): Fix Javadoc of `Flowable.toObservable` referring to `Publisher` instead of `Observable`.

### Version 2.0.7 - March 7, 2017 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.7%7C))

**Reactive-Streams compliance** 

*[Related issue 5110](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5110), [related pull 5112](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/5112).*

RxJava 2's `Flowable` was designed with Reactive-Streams compliance in mind but didn't follow all rules to the letter. A temporary workaround was the introduction of the `strict()` operator to enable full compliance. Unfortunately, according to the clarified stance from the specification leads, implementors of `Publisher` must honor the specification (despite its shortcomings) without excuses or workarounds. 

Honoring the specification adds a per-item cost of two atomic increments, manifesting in between the `Flowable` and an arbitrary `Reactive-Streams` compliant `org.reactivestreams.Subscriber`. See [Pull 5115](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/5115) for the benchmark comparison.

Starting from 2.0.7, the `Flowable.subscribe(org.reactivestreams.Subscriber)` now follows the spec by wrapping via the `StrictSubscriber` of the `strict()` operator unless the consuming instance implements a new interface specific to RxJava 2: `FlowableSubscriber`. 

The `FlowableSubscriber` extends `org.reactivestreams.Subscriber` but doesn't add any new methods and only overrides four of the textual rules of the specification to enable a relaxed operation within RxJava 2. All internal operators have been converted to use this new interface and thus don't have suffer the per-item overhead required by the specification, including the standard `DisposableSubscriber`, `TestSubscriber` and `ResourceSubscriber`. The lambda-based `subscribe()` operators were also retrofitted.

If you were implementing a `Subscriber` (directly or anonymously), you may want to change the interface to `FlowableSubscriber`. In order to avoid some of the runtime checks when subscribing to `Flowable` the new `subscribe(FlowableSubscriber)` has been introduced.

Note that the other reactive base types, `Observable`, `Single`, `Maybe` and `Completable` are not affected as these were never intended to implement the Reactive-Streams specification (they were only inspired by the spec and are RxJava 2 only to begin with).

### Version 2.0.6 - February 15, 2017 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.6%7C))

**Undeliverable exceptions**

One of the design goals of 2.x was that no errors can be lost. Sometimes, the sequence ends or gets cancelled before the source could emit an `onError` which has nowhere to go at that point and gets routed to the `RxJavaPlugins.onError`. 

Unlike 1.x, 2.x by default calls `Thread.currentThread().getUncaughtExceptionHandler().uncaughtException()` which crashes an Android app. Many developers have noticed the increased number of app crashes when porting to 2.x due to this behavior change. Note that this doesn't mean RxJava 2 is unstable but it means you likely had these exceptions all along but they were silently dropped.

Unfortunately, RxJava can't tell which of these out-of-lifecycle, undeliverable exceptions should or shouldn't crash your app. Identifying the source and reason for these exceptions can be tiresome, especially if they originate from a source and get routed to `RxJavaPlugins.onError` somewhere lower the chain.

Therefore, 2.0.6 introduces specific exception wrappers to help distinguish and track down what was happening the time of the error:

  - `OnErrorNotImplementedException`: reintroduced to detect when the user forgot to add error handling to `subscribe()`.
  - `ProtocolViolationException`: indicates a bug in an operator
  - `UndeliverableException`: wraps the original exception that can't be delivered due to lifecycle restrictions on a `Subscriber`/`Observer`. It is automatically applied by `RxJavaPlugins.onError` with intact stacktrace that may help find which exact operator rerouted the original error.

If an undeliverable exception is an instance/descendant of `NullPointerException`, `IllegalStateException` (`UndeliverableException` and `ProtocolViolationException` extend this), `IllegalArgumentException`, `CompositeException`, `MissingBackpressureException` or `OnErrorNotImplementedException`, the `UndeliverableException` wrapping doesn't happen.

In addition, some 3rd party libraries/code throw when they get interrupted by a cancel/dispose call which leads to an undeliverable exception most of the time. Internal changes in 2.0.6 now consistently cancel or dispose a `Subscription`/`Disposable` before cancelling/disposing a task or worker (which causes the interrupt on the target thread).

```java
// in some library
try {
   doSomethingBlockingly()
} catch (InterruptedException ex) {
   // check if the interrupt is due to cancellation
   // if so, no need to signal the InterruptedException
   if (!disposable.isDisposed()) {
      observer.onError(ex);
   }
}
```

If the library/code already did this, the undeliverable `InterruptedException`s should stop now. If this pattern was not employed before, we encourage updating the code/library in question.

### Version 2.0.5 - January 27, 2017 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.5%7C))

The most notable enhancement of this version is the inclusion of the `ParallelFlowable` API that allows parallel execution of a few select operators such as `map`, `filter`, `concatMap`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `reduce` and so on. Note that is a **parallel mode** for `Flowable` (a sub-domain specific language) instead of a new reactive base type. 

Consequently, several typical operators such as `take`, `skip` and many others are not available and there is no `ParallelObservable` because **backpressure** is essential in not flooding the internal queues of the parallel operators as by expectation, we want to go parallel because the processing of the data is slow on one thread.

The easiest way of entering the parallel world is by using `Flowable.parallel`:

```java
ParallelFlowable<Integer> source = Flowable.range(1, 1000).parallel();
```

By default, the parallelism level is set to the number of available CPUs (`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`) and the prefetch amount from the sequential source is set to `Flowable.bufferSize()` (128). Both can be specified via overloads of `parallel()`.

`ParallelFlowable` follows the same principles of parametric asynchrony as `Flowable` does, therefore, `parallel()` on itself doesn't introduce the asynchronous consumption of the sequential source but only prepares the parallel flow; the asynchrony is defined via the `runOn(Scheduler)` operator.

```java
ParallelFlowable<Integer> psource = source.runOn(Schedulers.io());
```

The parallelism level (`ParallelFlowable.parallelism()`) doesn't have to match the parallelism level of the `Scheduler`. The `runOn` operator will use as many `Scheduler.Worker` instances as defined by the parallelized source. This allows `ParallelFlowable` to work for CPU intensive tasks via `Schedulers.computation()`, blocking/IO bound tasks through `Schedulers.io()` and unit testing via `TestScheduler`. You can specify the prefetch amount on `runOn` as well.

Once the necessary parallel operations have been applied, you can return to the sequential `Flowable` via the `ParallelFlowable.sequential()` operator.

```java
Flowable<Integer> result = psource.filter(v -> v % 3 == 0).map(v -> v * v).sequential();
```

Note that `sequential` doesn't guarantee any ordering between values flowing through the parallel operators.

### Version 2.0.0 - October 29, 2016 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.0%7C))

This is it, general availability of RxJava 2! Rewritten from scratch to offer better performance, lower overhead, more features, a modern underlying technology and interoperation with the Reactive-Streams ecosystem. Big thanks goes to the several dozen people who gave feedback, fixes, enhancements and reviewed pull requests in the past, very intensive, 4 months.

Users are encouraged to read the wiki articles [What's different in 2.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0) and [Writing operators for 2.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Writing-operators-for-2.0) to get a overview about changes and differences between working with RxJava 1 and 2. If you find something missing or under-explained, don't worry and open an [issue](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues) about it!

Some other common libraries such as [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid/tree/2.x) and [Retrofit 2 Adapter](https://github.com/JakeWharton/retrofit2-rxjava2-adapter) were already following the 2.x development and you can expect them to release versions supporting the 2.0.0 GA shortly. In addition, there is an ongoing effort to port companion libraries of RxJava itself to support the 2.x line. For now, several ported features are available as part of the [RxJava2Extensions](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions) project. RxJava 1 and 2 can live side by side in the same project and the [RxJava2Interop](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Interop) library allows dataflow conversions between the two versions.

The sections below contain the changes since 2.0.0-RC5 beyond the general quality and test coverage improvements of the codebase.

### Version 2.0.0-RC3 - September 23, 2016 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.0-RC3%7C))

This Release Candidate features mostly internal cleanups of code and Javadoc, Reactive-Streams Test Compatibility Kit implementations (and thus verification) of our `Flowable` implementation and additional unit-test coverage. Big tanks to @vanniktech for the many contributions and @JakeWharton for the continued reviews.

Other notable changes:

  - The new `Maybe`  type of RC2 now features all relevant operators.
  - Many `Observable` and `Flowable` operators [now return](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0#different-return-types) `Single` or `Maybe`.
  - [Pull 4525](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4525) : Fixed generics of `combineLatest` and `zip` because `Function<? super T[], R>` doesn't work.
  - [Pull 4522](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4522) : Fixed `delay` operator to call `onError` on the provided scheduler 
  - [Pull 4490](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4490) : rename `isCancelled` to `isDisposed` inside the varios emitters of `create()`
  - [Pull 4504](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4504) : add default `XObserver` implementation to `Single`, `Maybe` and `Completable`
  - [Pull 4518](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4518) : add `ResourceXObserver` implementation to `Single`, `Maybe` and `Completable`
  - [Pull 4536](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4536) : fix `timeout` operators not properly cancelling/disposing the upstream.
  - [Pull 4583](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4583) : `Flowable.create()`'s `FlowableEmitter` didn't handle `null`s properly.
  - [Pull 4586](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4586) : Add error assertion with predicate to `TestSubscriber` and `TestObserver`.

In addition, the wiki page [What's different in 2.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0) has been extended with more information.

### Version 2.0.0-RC2 - September 5, 2016 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.0-RC2%7C))

This Release Candidate features a large amount of internal fixes, cleanups and enhancements. Please refer to the [closed PRs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%222.0+RC+2%22) for its milestone. This includes the bugfix for the `Single.subscribeOn` failing with `Disposable already set!` error printed to the console ([Issue 4448](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issue/4448), [Pull 4450](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/4450)).

The library now has a new base reactive type: `Maybe` which is essentially a `Single` and `Completable` combined. You can have exactly 1 onSuccess, 1 onError or 1 onComplete signals with it. Note however that it doesn't have all the operators possible for this type of source but you can convert it back and forth to the other base reactive types (i.e., `Flowable`, `Single`, `Completable` and `Observable`). Unlike Project Reactor's `Mono` type, this doesn't implement the Reactive-Streams `Publisher` (but is designed along the idea) and doesn't have backpressure (as there is no chance of buffer-bloat like with unknown length `Flowable`s and `Observable`s).


### Version 2.0.0-RC1 - August 25, 2016 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.0-RC1%7C))

RxJava 2.0 has been rewritten from scratch to be more performant, lower overhead (memory and cpu) and to natively implement the Reactive-Streams specification in its new `Flowable` type. The library still supports Java 6+ and is considered a **4th generation reactive library**.

There have been hundreds of PRs and large amounts of changes compared to the 1.x version. The two are binary-incompatible but their distinct maven coordinates (`io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.0.0-RC1`) allow them to co-exist. You can use the [rxjava2-interop](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Interop) library to convert between 1.x and 2.x types.

Please refer to the [wiki page about the differences between the two major versions](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0).

Converting the companion libraries is an ongoing effort. For now, see the [rxjava2-extensions](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions) project that contains the port of the [RxJavaMath](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaMath) features. Note that most companion libraries of RxJava are currently not set up properly for release (the signing keys are missing from the CI release process) and is unknown if and when they will have their own 2.x release branch.

I'd like to thank for the contributions of the following community members (in LIFO commit-merge order):

@davidmoten, @JakeWharton, @vanniktech, @dimitar-asenov, @artem-zinnatullin, @bobvanderlinden, @DmitriyZaitsev, @zsxwing, @bcorne, @stevegury, @benjchristensen, @stealthcode, @adam-arold and @abersnaze.

A special thanks goes out to @smaldini, [Project-Reactor](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core) lead at Pivotal. Our ongoing cooperation lead to the massive improvement of the RxJava 2.x architecture (originally designed in August 2015) by learning from and building upon the results of the [Reactive-Streams-Commons](https://github.com/reactor/reactive-streams-commons) research project.
